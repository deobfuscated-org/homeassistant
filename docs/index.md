This is not a replacement for the [Home Assistant Documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/) or the [Home Assistant Developer Docs](https://developers.home-assistant.io/), which are great.

This website aims to be an addition to that - explain things in a different way, allow half complete notes from developers that have tried things with the API where full docs do not exist, etc.
