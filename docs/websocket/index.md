# WebSocket

FIXME: header item says Websocket, not WebSocket, sidebar says Websocket and then also WebSocket.

If you are a developer interacting with Home Assistant in real time, it is likely you are using the Home Assistant [WebSocket API](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/websocket/).
The HA docs about it are extensive, but by no means complete.
It seems clear that that API is developed based on the needs of the usual HA web frontend, with supporting code in the backend, of course.

This section of this website aims to collect notes for problems you might run into, for which those docs do not have answers.
